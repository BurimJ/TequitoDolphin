          <h2>Welcome to Dolphin Swim Club</h2>
          <>Welcome to Dolphin Swim Club's website! Our club is dedicated to
          fostering competitive swimming skills and providing a supportive
          environment for swimmers of all ages. Our competitive swimmers are
          assigned to a coach who guides them in their training journey. They
          are divided into two age-based teams: the Youth Team for swimmers
          under 18 years old and the Senior Team for swimmers aged 18 and above.
          <p>
            Each competitive swimmer is registered based on their active
            swimming disciplines. Within each discipline, we continuously track
            and record each swimmer's best training results and the date
            achieved. For those swimmers who participate in competitions, we
            also document the event, placement, and time achieved. These
            individual swimmer results serve as the basis for the coach to
            select participants for upcoming competitions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our swimming disciplines include butterfly, freestyle (crawl),
            backstroke, and breaststroke. These disciplines are further
            categorized for both junior and senior swimmers. At Dolphin Swim
            Club, we strive to create a supportive and competitive atmosphere
            that encourages our swimmers to excel in their chosen disciplines.
            Join us and dive into the world of competitive swimming today!
          </p>
